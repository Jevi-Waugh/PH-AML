    Create a 2D grid from the 1D arrays
    meshgrid creates two 2D arrays so that for every ùë• 
    value, every  ùë¶ value is paired with it. 
    This "duplication" ensures that  the entire 2D space are covered due to angle range incompatibility.

    Every row in theta is a copy of theta_values.
    Every column in phi is a copy of phi_values.
